# Lexicon web page generator

![Tests](https://github.com/stevetasticsteve/Lexicon/workflows/Python%20application/badge.svg)

A program designed to assist those studying unwritten languages by
 generating a dictionary web page from spreadsheet.
 
Teams learning an unwritten language need to transcribe and document
thousands of words in the process of creating a dictionary. This program
aims to simplify that process by using familiar and comfortable software
as it's front end.

Teams use a spreadsheet ([Libre office](https://www.libreoffice.org/), or Excel) to edit and build the 
dictionary. All editing takes place in the spreadsheet.
This script then runs to generate a mobile friendly and searchable web 
page from the source spreadsheet that can shared and used as a team resource.

**Advantages**
- Users build the dictionary in a spreadsheet, no need to learn a complex program.
- The web page generated is mobile friendly and searchable for easy reference and sharing.
